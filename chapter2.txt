Chapter 2: The Past Reawakens

Serena investigates Grant’s study and discovers a hidden journal documenting his obsession with the decades-old murder of Clara Bennett, a young woman whose death was pinned on a drifter. Grant believed the drifter was innocent and had uncovered evidence pointing to someone powerful.

A second murder strikes—a librarian, killed in the same manner, with another cipher left behind. Nate deciphers it:
"Justice sleeps, but vengeance wakes."

This leads Serena to an abandoned warehouse filled with Clara’s belongings, including a bloodstained dress. Among the items is a photo of Clara with Victor Halstrom, a now-elderly real estate tycoon.
